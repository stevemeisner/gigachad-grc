# QA Testing Checklist

**Version:** 1.0.0-beta  
**Purpose:** Manual QA testing guide for critical user flows before public release

---

## Prerequisites

Before running QA tests:

1. **Start the platform:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/start-demo.sh
   ```
   This copies `env.development` to `.env` (which sets `AUTH_MODE=demo` and
   `VITE_AUTH_MODE=demo`), starts PostgreSQL and MinIO in Docker, applies the
   schema, starts the six services on the host and the Vite dev server, and
   loads demo data on the first run.

2. **Confirm it is up:**
   ```bash
   docker compose ps                                   # postgres + minio
   curl -fsS http://localhost:3001/api/system/health    # controls
   ```

3. **Access points:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (use `localhost`, not `127.0.0.1`)
   - Controls API docs: http://localhost:3001/api/docs
   - MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001 (`MINIO_ROOT_USER` / `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD` from `.env`)

> These tests run against the `AUTH_MODE=demo` bypass, which serves every
> request as the seeded admin (`john.doe@example.com`). Anything that depends on
> a real Google sign-in, on non-admin roles, or on a second organization cannot
> be exercised this way — see the notes in Test Suite 1.

## Test Suite 1: Authentication & Authorization

### 1.1 Sign-in

Identity is Firebase Authentication with Google sign-in only. There is no
username/password form, so "invalid credentials" and "token refresh" are
Google's behaviour, not this application's.

| Test | Steps | Expected Result | Status |
|------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Demo sign-in | 1. Open http://localhost:3000<br>2. Click **Dev Login (Skip SSO)** | Dashboard loads as John Doe (admin) | ⬜ |
| Session persistence | 1. Sign in<br>2. Refresh the page | Still signed in (demo session is kept in `sessionStorage`) | ⬜ |
| Logout | 1. Click the user menu<br>2. Click Logout | Returned to the login page, session cleared | ⬜ |
| Bypass is dev-only | 1. `cd frontend && npm run build`<br>2. `npm run preview` | No "Dev Login (Skip SSO)" button — it is gated on `import.meta.env.DEV` | ⬜ |
| Google sign-in (needs a Firebase project) | 1. Set `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` and the `VITE_FIREBASE_*` build-time values<br>2. Unset `AUTH_MODE`/`VITE_AUTH_MODE`<br>3. Click **Sign in with Google** | Google account chooser, then the dashboard | ⬜ |
| Domain allowlist (needs a Firebase project) | Sign in with a Google account outside `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAINS` | Rejected — a valid ID token is not enough | ⬜ |
| Unprovisioned account (needs a Firebase project) | Sign in with an allowed-domain account that has no `users` row and `AUTH_AUTO_PROVISION` unset | Rejected — the token proves identity only; access comes from PostgreSQL | ⬜ |

### 1.2 Authorization (RBAC)

Roles and permissions come from the `users` row and the permission tables in
PostgreSQL, never from the token. Under `AUTH_MODE=demo` the frontend's
`hasPermission()` returns true for every check and every request arrives as the
seeded admin, so these three rows require a real Firebase sign-in with
separately provisioned accounts.

| Test | Steps | Expected Result | Status |
|------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Admin sees all modules | Login as admin user | All navigation items visible | ⬜ |
| Viewer cannot edit | 1. Login as viewer<br>2. Try to edit a control | Edit button disabled or action rejected | ⬜ |
| Multi-tenant isolation | 1. Login as Org A user<br>2. Check data | Cannot see Org B data | ⬜ |

./scripts/start-demo.sh

# Infrastructure containers (postgres, minio)
docker compose ps

# Service logs — one file per service
tail -f .demo/logs/controls.log

# Load demo data (start-demo.sh already does this on the first run)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/seed/load-demo

# Reset all organization data before reloading
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/seed/reset \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"confirmationPhrase": "DELETE ALL DATA"}'

# Stop everything (add --clean to drop the volumes)
./scripts/stop-demo.sh
```
